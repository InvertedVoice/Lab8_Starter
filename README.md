# Question Answer
> How are graceful degradation and service workers related? (Answer this after doing the part below)
Service Workers enable graceful degradation by ensuring that websites continue functioning and displaying meaningful content should the network fail, which can be done by either caching key assets to load content even when on offline mode or providing fallback responsed when the network is unavailable. This provides the opportunity to preserve usabilty and their core functionality.
