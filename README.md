# Question Answer
> How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

Graceful Degradation is a design principle in which an app or a program is designed to provide it's core functionality even if the app is used on an older software that doesn't support some of the modern advanced features of the software. Service Workers enable graceful degradation by ensuring that websites continue functioning and displaying meaningful content should the network fail, which can be done by either caching key assets to load content even when on offline mode or providing fallback responsed when the network is unavailable. This provides the opportunity to preserve usabilty and their core functionality.
